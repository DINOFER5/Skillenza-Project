1. Train and Test are concatenated by dropping 'Grade' from train

2. Columns with less missing values are imputed with mean value

3. roof values are changed from 'yes','YES','NO','no' to jsut 'YES' and 'NO'
	
4. roof, which has many missing values is imputed by building a prediction model.
   By using a voting classifier of multiple models

5. Roof(area) missing values are changed to 0 if 'roof' has value 'NO'

6. Remaining values are imputed using XGBRegressor

7. We stripped $ from 'EXPECTED' column and changed it to integer

8. Multicolinearity is removed and data is made consistant

9. We perform cross validation with multiple models and compare the accuracy

10. Neural Networks is chosen as it has the highest accuracy

11. We choose the epoch value with the maximum validation accuracy 

12. When we obtain the grade value , it can be added to the starting test 
    And we dont drop it in the train this time
    We re-run the program and use the 'Grade' variable to predict 'roof' and 
    'Roof(Area)' . THIS CAUSES ACCURACY TO IMPROVE BY 2-3% when we create the model     again.
FINAL ACCURACY IN STAGE 1- 94.725674
